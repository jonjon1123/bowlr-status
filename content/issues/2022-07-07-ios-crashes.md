*Resolved* - A temporary work around has been rolled out in version 6.7.4 that should resolve these crashes. {{< track "2022-07-20 21:49:00" >}}

*Investigating* - Version 6.7.3 of the iOS Bowlr app is being impacted by a bug in an underlying dependency that is causing the app to crash. Work is being done to help the underlying dependency resolve their issue. As a work-around, users can uninstall and reinstall the Bowlr app. You **will not** lose any of your data by doing this. {{< track "2022-07-07 11:32:00" >}}
