*Resolved* - Apple has finally approved the changes to the app that enable the Bowlr Pro upgrade to be purchased. Please ensure you are using version 3.1.6 to get this fix. This issue is now resolved. {{< track "2019-09-06 14:00:00" >}}

*Update* - Another build was submitted to the Apple App Store reviewers that hopefully will meet their criteria. {{< track "2019-08-31 13:00:00" >}}

*Update* - The Apple App Store reviewers are not allowing the fixed version to be published. We are working with them to get this published ASAP. {{< track "2019-08-30 12:00:00" >}}

*Update* - A fix has been submitted to the Apple App Store that will resolve this. {{< track "2019-08-28 06:00:00" >}}

*Investigating* - The in app purchase to upgrade to Bowlr Pro is not working on iOS. This will not impact usage of the app if you have 12 games or fewer. It will impact usage if you try to add a 13th game. {{< track "2019-08-28 05:00:00" >}}
