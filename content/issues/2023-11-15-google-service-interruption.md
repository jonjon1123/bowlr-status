*Investigating* - Many Bowlr users are experiencing issues ranging from not being able to sign in to the app reporting purchases incorrectly. The root cause of this issues is an underlying issue with the Google database service Bowlr uses. Unfortunately, there is no workaround at this time. Google support engineers are working to resolve the issue. {{< track "2023-11-16 02:25:00" >}}
